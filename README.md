# C++ Pixels Library For Windows

This is the C++ Pixels library for Windows.
Windows Runtime [WinRT](https://github.com/microsoft/cppwinrt) APIs are used
to access Bluetooth.

Windows 10 version 1709 (Fall Creators Update) or more recent is required.

## Foreword

Pixels are full of LEDs, smarts and no larger than regular dice, they can be
customized to light up when and how you desire.
Check our [website](https://gamewithpixels.com/) for more information.

> **Warning**
> Before jumping into programming please make sure to read our Pixels developer's
> [guide](https://github.com/GameWithPixels/.github/blob/main/doc/DevelopersGuide.md).

Please open a [ticket](https://github.com/GameWithPixels/PixelsWinCpp/issues)
on GitHub if you're having any issue.

## Overview

This is the initial release of this C++ library for Windows.

All the library source code is currently included in the example app.

As such you will need to either copy the code in your own project or modify
this project to generate a library with the configuration your project requires.

There are many ways to configure a Visual Studio C++ library project and we didn't
want to pick one that is unsuitable for our users.
So we decided to postpone that decision and wait for community feedback.

Thank you for your understanding!
